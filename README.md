## Abstract

As recording and organizing relational data becomes a fundamental necessity in computational applications across multiple industrial domains, knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a popular option for modeling relationships between entities, in no small part due to their structural intuitiveness and general applicability. Recent appraisals of this potential have led to the sustained development of machine learning (ML) tools for embedding and extrapolating on existing KG datasets, with the purpose of aiding in statistical relational learning (SRL) tasks such as link prediction and entity classification. Although much literature exists on modifying and contrasting individual tools to identify ways in which their already plateauing efficiency can increase, literature analyzing the effects of preexisting graph characteristics on ML performance remains sparse. Through our research, we aim to prove that changes across these characteristics, particularly edge uniformity in relations guided by the Zipfian distribution, do reflect into corresponding changes in said model performance. Our results point towards differences in the studied parameter accounting for an increase in model accuracy across three distinct KG embedding predictive algorithms.

## Introduction

The present repository contains the results of our research, conducted from 2021-2022, on the effects of KG structural properties, particularly edge uniformity as dictated in relationships following the Zipfian distribution, on the performance of three KGE predictive algorithms.
